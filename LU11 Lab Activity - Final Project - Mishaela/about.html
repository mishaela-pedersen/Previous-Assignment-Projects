    <div class="panel">
      <p>Danganronpa: Suffering's Symphony is a fanmade visual novel mystery game based off of the Danganronpa franchise owned by Spike Chunsoft.
      You play as the game's Protagonist and interact with the world around you, usually within one specific place all of the students
      are trapped in. After a murder occurs the rest of the students gather and participate in what's called a Class Trial, where everyone debates
      using evidence and testimony who the murderer is. If the innocent students guess correctly, only the culprit (or the 'Blackened') gets punished.
      If they guess incorrectly, then everyone BUT the culprit gets punished and that person gets to 'graduate', or escape the game. The games usually have six main chapters and trials, and a set number of survivors
      by the end of the game. The 6th chapter is the final chapter where the mastermind of the game is revealed. All of the series' cast is consistent of a group of 16 students who all have unique special talents, known as 'Ultimates' (or 'Super High School Level Talent' in the original Japanese translation).</p>

    <button class="accordion" onclick="openAccordion()">About the Story</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>You play as Michiru Tsukino, a student who awoke on the space station with no memory of what her Ultimate Talent is. Michiru and the 15 other students all
          have no recollection of how, why, or when they arrived on the space station. Monokoro (pronounced Mohn-oh-core-oh) soon reveals that they are currently trapped on the space station with
          no way out or to contact Earth. They are set to be trapped there for the rest of eternity, unless of course, someone wins the "Killing Game".
          Unlike the official games its based off of, instead of immediate punishment, the culprit gets one last chance to escape by undergoing a monstrous transformation
          and defeating the chosen champion of the student's choice. Rather than the game's normal punishment cutscenes.
          The game is overall designed to be more family friendly for a wider general audience, instead of older teen and young adult audiences.</p>

    <button class="accordion" onclick="openAccordion()">About the Engine</button>
    <div class="panel" id="panel">
      <p>The coding engine used for this game is the visualnovel engine Renpy, a free open source python engine designed for making interactive graphic novels,
        or visual novels. However, a more complete and polished version with more mini games will be built using Unity at a later date.</p>
