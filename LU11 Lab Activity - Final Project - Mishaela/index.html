	  website for my own WIP fan game - Danganronpa: Suffering's Symphony.
	  It features a characters gallery, an 'About' page, and a brief personality
	  quiz to match you with a character that you're the most like.
	  Keep in mind that most of the characters, art, and storyline are my own original works
	  so please do not share them without asking me first.
